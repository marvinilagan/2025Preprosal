A website for my videography and photography portfolio.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My website will be a portfolio page of my videography and photography work. Users will be able to view images and videos.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Homepage, About me section, and Photography section.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Homepage, About me section, Photography section, and Videography section.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All features listed above + Contact section, Testimonial section, and Services section.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In order to accomplish this project, I will need to do a lot of research on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Thankfully, I already have
some previous knowledge in HTML and JavaScript from my previous college. Most of this rsearch will be
done through YouTube tutorials and online forum pages. For debugging and troubleshooting, I am planning
to use ChatGPT to help fix errors that I cannot find online resources for. Besides the coding aspect,
I will need to curate a portfolio of my best work to feature in the portfolio. I will also need to find
inspiration from other media portfolios to get a general idea of how I would want to create my own.
